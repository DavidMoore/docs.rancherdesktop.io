[{"title":"About","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"","content":"About Rancher Desktop is an open-source desktop application for Mac, Windows and Linux. It provides Kubernetes and container management. You can choose the version of Kubernetes you want to run. You can build, push, pull, and run container images. The container images you build can be run by Kubernetes immediately without the need for a registry.","keywords":""},{"title":"FAQ","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"faq","content":"FAQ This FAQ is a work in progress designed to answer the questions our users most frequently ask about Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher? A: No, Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the desktop. Installing Rancher Desktop does not install Rancher, but you can install Rancher as a workload. Rancher Desktop is similar to applications like minikube, kind, or Docker Desktop where the goal is to have an easy to set up local Kubernetes environment to manage containers. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop? A: Yes, there are no conflicts having both installed. For Rancher Desktop v0.6.1 and earlier, you can even run both simultaneously if resources permit. This may change for future releases.","keywords":""},{"title":"Installation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"installation","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"macOS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installation","url":"installation#macos","content":""},{"title":"Requirements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installation","url":"installation#requirements","content":"Rancher Desktop requires the following on macOS: macOS Catalina 10.15 or higher.Intel CPU with VT-x.Persistent internet connection.
