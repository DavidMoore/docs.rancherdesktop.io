[{"title":"FAQ","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"faq","content":"FAQ This FAQ is a work in progress designed to answer the questions our users most frequently ask about Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher? A: No, Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the desktop. Installing Rancher Desktop does not install Rancher, but you can install Rancher as a workload. Rancher is a unified multi-cluster management stack, whereas Rancher Desktop is similar to applications like minikube, kind, or Docker Desktop, where the goal is to have an easy to set up local Kubernetes environment to manage containers. Q: Can I open Cluster Manager in Rancher Desktop? A: No, the Cluster Manager feature is currently a Rancher-only concept. We are working on an early integration of the Rancher Dashboard in an upcoming release and will notify the community when this becomes available. To learn more about Rancher Desktop, click here. To learn more about Rancher, click here. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop? A: Yes, but they cannot be run at the same time as both Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop use the same Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock). Before starting one, be sure to stop the other first. Q: How can I perform a clean uninstall of Rancher Desktop? A: First, perform a Factory Reset, and then you will uninstall the app. The uninstall process varies based on the operating system. For more information, please refer here. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do? A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs? A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it? A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do? A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened? A: The docker compose subcommand is bundled as part of a Docker Desktop installation and is removed when uninstalled. Future versions of Rancher Desktop will include and automatically docker compose for you, but until then you can install it using this procedure: For MacOS: $ cd /tmp $ mkdir dc-work $ cd dc-work $ curl -o docker-compose -kL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-darwin-x86_64 $ chmod +x docker-compose $ mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/ $ mv docker-compose ~/.docker/cli-plugins/ $ cd .. $ rmdir dc-work Copy For Linux, and in a Linux subsystem on Windows: $ cd /tmp $ mkdir dc-work $ cd dc-work $ curl -o docker-compose -kL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 $ chmod +x docker-compose $ mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/ $ mv docker-compose ~/.docker/cli-plugins/ $ cd .. $ rmdir dc-work Copy For Windows, in a powershell session: $ cd $Env:TEMP # (or $Env:TMP) $ mkdir dc-work $ cd dc-work $ iwr -UseBasicParsing -OutFile docker-compose.exe https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-windows-x86_64.exe $ mkdir $ENV:HOMEPATH/.docker/cli-plugins -Force $ mv docker-compose.exe $ENV:HOMEPATH/.docker/cli-plugins/ $ cd .. $ rmdir dc-work Copy Also, on Windows, don't forget to also set up docker-compose on the Linux side as well, described above. Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop, how do I disable it to save resources? A: As a temporary workaround, you can disable Kubernetes in Rancher Desktop with these commands: kubectl config use-context rancher-desktop kubectl delete node lima-rancher-desktop Copy Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)? A: As of version 1.0 Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why? A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why? A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page are not installed and I see a Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it? A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop is able to create the symlinks. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop? A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL? A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Copy Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux? A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Copy","keywords":""},{"title":"Overview","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Container Management​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Overview","url":"#container-management","content":"Rancher Desktop provides the ability to build, push, and pull container images along with the ability to run containers.
